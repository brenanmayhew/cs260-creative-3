# cs260-creative-3
For this lab, you will create a website that uses Vue for the front end. This website can be for anything you want, but should not be similar to the Vue apps we have already built so far. You must create your own original work. You creative projects can build on each other.

# Pair Programming
We have provided an initial set of random pair programming partners for everyone. See this [team's spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1c5lOrCENOqa_Lfs2T_SSVozyBbTdY9bMgb6I4_trh1s/edit#gid=9507285).

## Requirements
This is a creative project, so you are welcome to build what you would like. The basic requirements are:

- [ ] The site uses Vue
- [ ] The site contains a footer that links to your public GitHub repository

The GitHub repository should be in your own GitHub account.

## Rubric for Grading
We will grade your projects based on:
- [ ] you used Vue for the entire site
- [x] how well you follow web design principles: spacing, typography, color, consistency, and responsive design.

TAs will assign scores in these ranges:

-[ ] 90-100: Excellent use of Vue, clearly follows web design principles
-[ ] 80-90: Uses Vue, good effort was made, but needs work to more clearly present the data or follow web design principles
-[ ] 70-80: Fulfills the minimum requirement of using Vue, but does not make a strong effort to use it well or follow web design principles

## Submission
On Canvas, submit the URL for your website, which should be running on your DigitalOcean server. 
You will also be assigned 5 peer reviews in Canvas, after all the assignments are turned in. We will do these in class and also have demos.
